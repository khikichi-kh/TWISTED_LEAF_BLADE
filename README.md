# TWISTED_LEAF_BLADE

This is a set of computational models based on GFtbox associated with the paper "Leftâ€“right asymmetry causes twisting in rice (Oryza sativa) leaves via physical interaction between organs", by K.Hikichi, S.Okada _et al_., _New Phytologist_, 2025.

This can be run using the Matlab package GFtbox, which is available from [here](https://github.com/JIC-Enrico-Coen/GrowthToolbox). 
GFtbox requires an installation of MATLAB.
